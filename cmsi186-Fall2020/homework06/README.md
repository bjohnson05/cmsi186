## The Problem:
[Sir Richard Branson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson), owner of Virgin Galactic, is VERY interested in space travel.  He is teaming up with quite a few companies to make a spacecraft that will carry humans to space, but he knows there are several other companies that are trying to do that as well.  He wants to beat Bezos and Musk so he can be first at something, and has set his sights on being the first company to offer round-trip rides to the planet Neptune, some 4.4 Billion Kilometers away from Earth.  The round-trip will thus be over 8.8 Billion Km.  However, to save costs, Branson has decided on instruments that can only measure <strong>meters</strong>, not <strong>Kilometers</strong>, so that means the distance will be some <em class='underline'>8.8 Trillion meters</em>.

Another factor is the amount of time it will take.  If we can travel at the speed of light, which is some 299,792,458 meters/second, we can get there in a mere 8.15 hours.  However, since travel and that speed isn't possible, and since we can't instantaneously <q>jump to light speed</q>, we will have to make do by ramping up linearly to half the speed of light for the trip, then decelerate when we get there, and reverse that process on the way back.


## For this homework:
You will develop public class <code>BrobdingnagianInt</code>, [also known as "BrobInt"], whose objects model arbitrarily-large integers.  Basically, you are being asked to re-invent some of the material of <code>java.Math.BigInteger</code> to accomplish the following activities.

### Ground Rules
1. You must implement your class from first principles; in particular, you may not make use of java.Math.BigInteger or any related device [except for testing purposes if you want to check on the correctness of your test results for your <code>BrobdingnagianInt</code> class].
1. In the descriptions that follow, the word <code>"this"</code> refers to an instantiated object of your <code>BrobdingnagianInt</code> class.
1. It is recommended for testing purposes that you abbreviate <strong>BrobdingnagianInt</strong> as <strong>BrobInt</strong> which will be much easier to type.  You will be typing this over and over and over and over, so it is best if you get used to the shorter name from the start.
1. Although it can contain more methods [see java.math.BigInteger for more ideas], your class must include <strong>at least</strong> the following items:
    1. <code>public BrobInt( String value )</code><br />
// mimics one of the several java.math.BigInteger constructors<br />
    1. <code>public BrobInt add( BrobInt value )</code><br />
// returns a BrobInt whose value is the sum of this plus the argument<br />
    1. <code>public BrobInt subtract( BrobInt value )</code><br />
// returns a BrobInt whose value is the difference of this minus the argument<br />
    1. <code>public BrobInt multiply( BrobInt value )</code><br />
// returns a BrobInt whose value is the product of this times the argument<br />
    1. <code>public BrobInt divide( BrobInt value )</code><br />
// returns a BrobInt whose value is the quotient of this divided by the argument<br />
    1. <code>public BrobInt remainder( BrobInt value )</code><br />
// returns a BrobInt whose value is the remainder of this divided by the argument<br />
    1. <code>public String toString()</code><br />
// returns the decimal string represention of this BrobInt<br />
    1. <code>public int compareTo( BrobInt value )</code><br />
// returns -1/0/1 as this BrobInt is numerically less than/equal to/greater than the value passed as the argument<br />
    1. <code>public boolean equals( Object x )</code><br />
// returns true iff x is a BrobInt whose value is numerically equal to this BrobInt<br />
    1. <code>public static BrobInt valueOf( long value )</code><br />
// a BrobInt "static factory" for constructing BrobInt out of longs<br />
    1. <code>public static final BrobInt ZERO</code><br />
// a BrobInt classwide constant for zero<br />
    1. <code>public static final BrobInt ONE</code><br />
// a BrobInt classwide constant for one<br />
    1. <code>public static final BrobInt TEN</code><br />
// a BrobInt classwide constant for ten<br />
1. Following the programming practice known as Test Driven Development [TDD] you must first construct unit tests for the above items <em>before coding the methods themselves</em>.  Use the main() method of your class to invoke these unit tests. [In other words, the command <code>java BrobIntTester</code> will run your unit tests.]  Try using Java's <code>assert</code> statement in the tests you write; or even better, use <strong>JUnit</strong>.
1. Complete as many of the items as possible. All incomplete items must throw an exception; use <strong><code>UnsupportedOperationException</code></strong>.
1. **For part two of this assignment**, you will write the program <code>Neptune.java</code> which will help Sir Richard achieve his goal. Your program will take one command line argument, which is the acceleration factor for the trip. Your program with then use that number to speed the spacecraft up to 1/2 the speed of light from a starting speed of 11,186 meters/second [the escape velocity of Earth], and slow it down again in time to reach Neptune at a speed of 23,500 meters/second. We then need to reverse the calculation to get back to Earth.
1. Try several different command line values to see what happens. If you enter something too small, you run the risk of reaching 1/2 the speed of light too late to slow down again, and you'll miss the planet. Don't worry, this isn't the same as the soccer balls [it's not 1% of the current speed per second], it's a constant addition [or subtraction] for every second.
1. Your program should report the **TOTAL DURATION OF THE JOURNEY** in hours, minutes, and seconds, along with the **VALUE OF ACCELERATION USED**.

## Notes and Suggestions:
1. **Do not be fooled by appearances**: this assignment is a lot more challenging than it looks. The good news is that for each operation, you already have detailed knowledge of some algorithm â€” although you will discover that expressing the algorithms in a computer programming language is a whole new can of worms!
1. **There will be at least three Java files for this assignment**:<br />
   1. The <code>BrobInt.java</code> file containing the methods listed above, as well as any other helper methods or extra things you may want to implement
   1. The <code>BrobIntTester.java</code> file containing your tests, which <em>may</em> end up in your main program of your BrobInt.java file, but it is highly recommended that this be a separate file
   1. The <code>Neptune.java</code> program file in which you implement your BrobInt to to calculate and display the results of your space journey acceleration factor and journey time
1. <strong>There are alternatives</strong> to some of the time-honored algorithms, [e.g., Russian Peasant multiplication], which tend to be easier to program.  [This is especially true if you have taken CMSI 185 with Dr. Johnson.  You may even come to decide that they are easier to use in practice!]  Feel free to implement them, instead of the time-honored techniques.
1. Similarly, arithmetic is easier in some bases than others, e.g., binary vs. decimal.  You should consider this when you decide on an internal representation for your objects.
1. Feel free to create versions of your methods that can act recursively; possessing such facility can be a handy tool for all kinds of things involving repetitive calculations.
1. **NEW**: [Here](https://github.com/bjohnson05/cmsi186/blob/master/cmsi186-Spring2019/homework06/BrobIntTester.java) is a test program that you can use/adapt for your purposes.  Note that this program simply tests several of the methods in the class, it DOES NOT catch any exceptions thrown, so it will stop with the first un-implemented method test. You may want to modify this to allow the test program to continue and recover gracefully from those exceptions, more like what happens in the real world.  You have a model of this already in the Date and String assignments you did earlier in the semester.
1. **Don't forget the three most important rules for software success**:
    * Commit early and commit often
    * Test, test, and test again
    * Start assignments early, using an iterative approach to your development
1. If you do any searching for things on your own, feel free to share them with me and with each other, <strong>AS LONG AS THEY ARE ALGORITHMIC DESCRIPTIONS AND NOT YOUR ACTUAL CODE</strong>.
1. Don't forget to check the image files above for hints on "chunkification and "Russian Peasant Multiplication [RPM]"
1. The **escape velocity of Earth** is 11186 meters per second; the **escape velocity of Neptune** is 23500 meters per second.
