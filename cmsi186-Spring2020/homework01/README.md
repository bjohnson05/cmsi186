# CMSI homework01 ~ MUSIC MASHUP

## Background

Since Dr. Toal likes to play music when you come into class, you would like to make some requests for music that he can play.  He *does* take requests, but only from a certain select set of music categories.

Fortunately you're not starting from scratch and some of your LMU student friends have provided you with a list of albums and artists. Unfortunately, some of the files have gotten mixed up...

Not to worry! With the *command line*, you'll have them straightened out in no time! :)

## Task

Download the zip file from this repo to your local hard drive, and unzip it into your <q>homework01</q> folder.  Then rearrange all the files and folders to make sure every song artist is in the correct genre folder (note: there might be multiple genres that fit, so feel free to make copies of some artists and put them into multiple genre folders) and that each artist folder has the right artist inside it.  Be careful or you might end up listening to Dolly Parton instead of Nicki Minaj!

You can start by using the GUI (i.e., you can move documents around by clicking and dragging from one folder to another in either Windows or mac O/S), but once you're comfortable doing that, you should face this challenge straight from the command line using a terminal window.

Once everything is in the right place, <em>CONGRATULATIONS</em>!  You've officially learned how to speak <q>computerese</q>. Ready to take it a step further?  Let's talk extensions...

## Extensions

0. Once you're sure everything is in the right place, brainstorm other genres, artists, and albums that you want to listen to, and add them into your file tree!
1. Mix up all of your files again, then make your way into a song/album/artist of your choice.  Reorganize the files again, while **staying** in that movie.

## What to turn in

0. Write down all the commands you used to organize the file.  Don't worry about efficiency for now ~ you should feel free to explore!  Include commands such as ```ls``` or ```pwd``` or ```dir``` or ```ren``` that helped you to figure out where everything was located.
1. If you did any extensions, write down the commands you used for those as well.
2. Push all the directories with their newly sorted files to your GitHub repo under your ```homework01``` folder/directory.
